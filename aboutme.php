                Hi! ðŸ˜„ <br><br>
                My name is Sarah and I was diagnosed with ADHD 3 years ago. I got to know ADHD pretty early during my
                time in primary school. A schoolmate of mine was diagnosed with it. I didn't know much about ADHD, only
                that hyperactivity is a symptom. Only later I've found out, that there was more to ADHD than just
                hyperactivity.
                <br><br>

                A couple years ago my mother got diagnosed with ADHD. I was reading up on symptoms and the differences
                ADHD has on boys, girls and adults. Since I could identify with certain symptoms I went to see a
                psychiatrist to check if I possibly could have the same diagnosis and I did. <br><br>

                Over time I've collected some of my favorite strategies on how to best work with my ADHD and I have
                created Brainfuzz as a tool to help myself and others with ADHD. <br><br>

                Let me know if you have any suggestions or comments on how Brainfuzz could be more effective for you.
